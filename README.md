### Heyo!

I'm Chris, a data scientist based in Oxfordshire, UK. I'm a recovering academic with a love for data visualization and making tools that are useful to people.

I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/) working at the intersection of data science and social impact.
